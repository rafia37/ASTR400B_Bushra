\begin{abstract}
    A sentence that defines the topic
    2. A sentence that says why the topic is important
    3. A sentence that says what question you are exporing 4. A sentence about why that question is important
    5. A sentence that states what you found
    6. A conclusion about what your finding means.
    The rest of the report should expand on each of the above bullet points in the abstract. Follow the below guidelines.

\section{Introduction}

    Define the topic you are studying and state why it matters. Overview our current understanding of the topic.
    What are the open questions?
    Cite at least 3 journal papers.

\section{This Project}

    State what question(s) you are exploring
    Why is each question interesting/important? Relate back to intro.


\section{Methods}

    Write a paragraph that describes the simulation you are using. Details can be found in: van der Marel, Besla +2012 ApJ 753
    Describe the code you wrote. What equations did you use? At least one component of the code must be unique to you (you canâ€™t only use code from homework and in class labs - but you can use the solutions as a starting point to create your code).
    
\section{Results}
    
    1. Include at least two plots (with proper labels and figure captions). 
    2. Describe what your code returned. What did you find? Describe what is in the plot.

\section{Discussion}

    What did you learn? What do your results mean? What is the importance of your results ?

\section{Conclusion}

    1. Summarize your report - i.e expand a bit on each line of the abstract.
    2. Comment on future directions - what other things could you do to explore the topic further?
