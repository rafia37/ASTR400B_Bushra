\section{Question 3}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item In this simulation MW and M31 have comparable mass, both being approximately equal to $2.05993 \times 10^{12}$ \(M_\odot\). In both cases, the halo dominates the total mass.
        \item M31 has more stellar mass. I expect M31 to be more luminous.
        \item MW and M31 have approximately equal dark matter mass ($MW/M31 = 1.02$).
        \item The baryon fraction is 0.0413, 0.0675 and 0.0475 for MW, M31 and M33 respectively. 
    \end{enumerate}
